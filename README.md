# HAML Templates for Twitter Bootstrap 3
These are direct copies of Bootstrap Examples, like Jumbotron, written in the
HAML templating language. They were tested on Sinatra.  

## Navbar Examples
There are three Navbar examples:
+ Navbar  
+ Static Top Navbar 
+ Fixed Navbar

Each Navbar is only available from within its respective haml file. For example
if you are using `navbar.haml` and you click on "Static Top" it will not work
without modifying the `navbar.haml` file.
